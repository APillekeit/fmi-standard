=== Co-Simulation with Early Return [[co-simulation-with-early-return]]
:DOSTEP: fmi3DoStep()
 
Based on early return an FMU shall be able to signal internal state changes i.e. discontinuity events to a co-simulation master at any time (not only at the end of a  current `{DOSTEP}` function call). 
The first time an FMU internal event for a time instant occurred, it has to be handled by the co-simulation master by creating a new communication point for that FMU.
An event signal in this proposal shall not be seen in the narrow sense of solver induced discontinuity events but in the general sense of a simulation event that has to be handled by the co-simulation master (e.g. state changes that require extended handling).
That way multiple event types and also triggered clock ticks or interrupts can be covered with the same concept.

//===	Changes in modelDescription.xml
//New capability flag `canHandleEarlyReturn`  = `true/false`.
