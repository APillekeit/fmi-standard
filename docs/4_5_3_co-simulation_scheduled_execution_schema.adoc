=== FMI Description Schema

The simulation master collects the information about the number and properties of clocks supported by the FMU via analyzing the modelDescription.xml as defined in section 2.2. and 4.3.

Each clock that ticks outside of the FMU is activated for an FMU based on its clockReference. 
There is a direct one-to-one relation for a clock and a model partition.

If clocks are defined and the flag `canHandleScheduledExecutionSimulation` equals true, the co-simulation master can set the fmuType to `fmi3ScheduledExecutionSimulation`. 
If no inferred clocks are defined the flag `canHandleScheduledExecutionSimulation` shall not be set to true.

==== Example XML Description File

The example below is the same one as shown in section [TBD] for a `fmi3ClockedCoSimulation` FMU.
