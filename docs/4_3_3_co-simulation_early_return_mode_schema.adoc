==== FMI Description Schema

The simulation master collects the information about the capability of an FMU to perform an early return by analyzing the modelDescription.xml as defined in section <<fmi-description-schema>> and <<CoSimulation>> #[TODO]: @ Masoud: Recheck (original sections 2.2. and 4.3)#.


===== Co-Simulation FMU (CoSimulation)
In order to support the early return in `fmi3DoStep` the capability flag  `canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate` in the XML should be `true`. 

 #[TODO]: New image similiar to images/cs_xml_1.png where the capability flag `canReturnEarlyAfterIntermediateUpdate` is set?#


===== Example XML Description File


Here is an example of an XML of an FMU supporting early return.
