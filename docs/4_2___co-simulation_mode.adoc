=== Co-Simulation [[co-simulation]]

This chapter defines the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) for the coupling of two or more simulation models in a co-simulation environment (FMI for Co-Simulation).
Co-simulation is a rather general approach to the simulation of coupled technical systems and coupled physical phenomena in engineering with focus on instationary (time-dependent) problems.
