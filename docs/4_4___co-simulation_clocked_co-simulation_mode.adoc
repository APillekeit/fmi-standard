=== Clocked Co-Simulation  [[clocked-co-simulation]]

Each model rate in a model is associated to a model partition of the model.
For FMI for Co-Simulation, the ticking of a clock is interpreted as an activity of the associated model partition.
During simulation, the co-simulation master updates values of input and outputs of FMUs at Communication Points (CP) for each model rate (i.e. model partition, i.e. inferred clock).
For supporting multiple rates of a model, a relation of clock ticks and communication points has to be established.
