=== Clocked Co-Simulation  [[clocked-co-simulation]]

Each model rate in a model is associated to a model partition of the model.
For FMI for Co-Simulation, the ticking of a clock is interpreted as an activity of the associated model partition.
During simulation, the co-simulation master updates and manages values of inputs and outputs of FMUs and further models at communication points (CP) for each model rate (i.e. model partition, i.e. inferred clock).
For supporting multiple rates of a model, a relation of clock ticks and communication points has to be established.
